My Little C Ciphers
======
Ciphers currently comitted: Vigenere, Caesar (and Caesar Bruteforce)
To come: Rail Fence, RSA (?)

Hi github !
In this repo you will find the littles ciphers I write while I am learning C. 
Every comitted file should compile and work unless specified in the header.

Don't hesitate to send me a message, a mail or to comment my codes ;)
